# RCWA (Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis)

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), 
a numerical method used to analyze the scattering and diffraction of electromagnetic waves by periodic structures.
It includes a detailed formulation document, code, and examples.

### V2 Update Plan
- Provide efficient algorithm that is flexible for:
  - Simplify for homogeneous case
  - Stable isotropic case
  - Extended anisotropic case
- Provide advanced visualization capability
  - Calculate and display electric field inside structures

## Documentation (WIP)
- [RCWA Documentation](https://github.com/chiuhans111/RCWA/wiki)

## Directory Structure
- `formulation/`: 
  - Contains the formulation document in both docx and pdf formats, providing a detailed explanation of the RCWA method.
- `rcwa`: main package
- `test`: tests and examples
## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Dependencies:
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - Matplotlib (for plotting)
  - SciPy (for solving eigenproblems)

## Formulation
The document available in the `formulation/` directory provides derivations of the mathematical equations, and implementation details of the RCWA method.

## Code Implementation

The `notebook/rcwa_v1.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file contains the code implementation of the RCWA method. 
The provided code achieves energy conservation (T+R=1). 
The notebook also includes visualization capabilities to explore and visualize some of the modes obtained through RCWA calculations.

Feel free to modify the code according to your specific requirements, 
such as changing the incident angle, wavelength, or the number of harmonics. 
Experiment with different parameters and explore the visualization of various modes.

## Known Issues
- Unstable, numerical error when using large harmonics, period=wavelength cases.

## Examples
*results obtained from RSoft DiffractMOD and our implementation of the RCWA method.*

The simulations were conducted under the following conditions: 
a wavelength of 530 nm, incidence angle of 30 degrees,
grating period of 530 nm, groove depth ranges from 0 to 4 times the period (2120 nm), 
refractive index of 1.581 for both grating and substrate, symmetrical triangular groove shape, and TE polarization. 

Error comparison, RMSE: 0.276%

in case b, the depth is 1.309 nm, with a slant angle of 12.55 degrees; 
in case c, the depth is 1.346 nm, with symmetric triangular groove.

RMSE: 0.262%
